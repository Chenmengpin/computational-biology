# the aim of this pipeline is to find chromosomal coordinates of transcription factor binding sites 
# for regulons that are key to fetal developmental stages as identified by SCENIC

# used FIMO from the MEME suite
# FIMO scans a set of sequences for individual matches to each of the motifs you provide
export PATH=$HOME/meme/bin:$HOME/meme/libexec/meme-5.1.0:$PATH

# used JASPAR meme formatted core motifs obtained from http://jaspar.genereg.net/download/CORE/JASPAR2020_CORE_non-redundant_pfms_meme.txt
# from the JASPAR file I extracted the motifs for each master TF (regulon name according to SCENIC) for three cell types (microglia, GABAprecursors and GABAinterneurons based on the heatmap of regulon*cell type)

# I used hg38 genome build from ensemble 
# for each chromosome, the fasta-get-markov in the MEME suite was used to generate a 5th-order Markov model of kmer frequencies:
fasta-get-markov -m 5 hg38chromFA/chr$.fa > hg38_background_models/hg38.chr$.5th_order_background_model.txt

# FIMO query 
# used threshold of 1e-6 instead of 1e-4
fimo --verbosity 2 --parse-genomic-coord --bfile hg38_background_models/hg38.chr$.5th_order_background_model.txt --thresh 1e-6 --text  motifs_JASPAR.txt hg38chromFA/chr$.fa > hg38.chr$.bed

# cat FIMO output from separate chromosomes
cat hg38.chr*.bed > hg38.chr.microglia.bed

# convert FIMO output to sorted bed file 
cat hg38.chr.microglia.bed | grep -v motif_alt_id | cut -f2-9 | tr '|' '\t' | sort -k1,1V -k2,2n > hg38.chr.microglia.sorted.bed
# remove tab at end of line
sed 's/\t$//' hg38.chr.microglia.sorted.bed > tmp1.bed
# move first column (gene name) to be last we need to have the coorindates as the second and third columns
awk '{first = $1; print $0, first}' tmp1.bed | cut -f2-7 > hg38.chr.microglia.sorted.bed
# use sortBed to overcome out of order issues 
sort -k1,1 -k2,2n hg38.chr.microglia.sorted.bed > tmp2.bed
mv tmp2.bed hg38.chr.microglia.sorted.bed 

# run bedtools closest to find sequences upstream, within and downstream target genes
# reporting top 10 closest hits as this was more concordant with SCENIC predictions of regulons (i.e. target genes predicted to be regulated by particular TFs)
# D reports the closest feature in B, and its distance to A as an extra column, and uses negative distances to report upstream features
# When A is on the - strand, “upstream” means B has a higher (start,stop)
# 0 distance means an overlap
bedtools closest -a hg38Tables_ensembl.sorted.bed -b microglia/hg38.chr.microglia.sorted.bed -D a -k 10 > microglia/microglia_motifs_genes_output.bed
