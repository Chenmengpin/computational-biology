Background. Malaria kills nearly one-half million people a year and over 1 billion people are at risk of becoming infected by the parasite. Plasmodial infections are difficult to treat for a myriad of reasons, but the ability of the organism to remain latent in hosts and the complex life cycles greatly contributed to the difficulty in treat malaria. 

Method. Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) enable hierarchical integration of disparate data types into a framework amenable to computational simulations enabling deeper mechanistic insights from high-throughput data measurements. In this project, GEMs of multiple Plasmodium species are used to study metabolic similarities and differences across the Plasmodium genus. 

Results. In silico gene-knock out simulations across species and stages uncovered functional metabolic differences between human- and rodent-infecting species as well as across the parasiteâ€™s life-cycle stages. 

Significance. These findings may help identify drug regimens that are more effective in targeting human-infecting species across multiple stages of the organism rather than current therapies which are targeted against single stages. In addition, the human- and rodent- infecting models would enable translation of findings from experimental diseases models to human clinical setting.
